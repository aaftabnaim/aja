This is game built to display how the minimax algorithm works without alpha-beta pruning.
There is only one winning sequence in this game.
This is based on the code made by Trevor Payne in his youtube video on the minimax algorithm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fInYh90YMJU.
I have fixed some minor issues and also added the comments.
